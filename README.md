# 📊 Uber Operations & Revenue Analytics Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive, multi-page analytics dashboard inspired by Uber’s ride-sharing operations. The dashboard analyzes operational efficiency, revenue performance, customer behavior, vehicle utilization, geographic demand, and cancellation reasons using data-driven insights.

The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world business intelligence use case where stakeholders can make informed, data-backed decisions using interactive dashboards.

- Which vehicle types generate the highest revenue?
- What time slots experience peak and low ride demand?
- Why are bookings being cancelled or lost?
- Which locations contribute most to pickups and drop-offs?
- How strong is customer acquisition compared to retention?
- Where is revenue being lost due to operational inefficiencies?
